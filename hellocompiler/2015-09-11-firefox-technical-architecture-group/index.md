Dave Camp 一个月前在邮件列表中宣布了新的 Firefox 架构领导小组:

> We don't have a lot of people whose responsibility extends to the entire Firefox frontend. Most of us are focused on individual pieces of our large codebase. Meanwhile, we have a set of large technical challenges ahead of us. In particular, gofaster and figuring out what comes after XUL are going to be sweeping changes that affect large swaths of code.
> 
> We are asking Dave Townsend, Richard Newman, Rob Helmer, Mark Hammond, and Robert Strong to explicitly take over technical stewardship of the Firefox products. Their responsibilities will be:
> 
> \* Document and build consensus around larger projects that affect Firefox products. \* Help resolve technical issues that cross functional areas of the project. \* Provide a point of consistent technical decision making. \* Be a point of contact for and coordinate cross-technology projects with other Mozilla groups such as Platform and Content Services. \* Be available to technical contributors for guidance, mentoring, etc.
> 
> This may look a lot like Module Ownership - this is no coincidence. Mark Finkle (as Firefox Mobile module owner) and I (as Firefox Desktop module owner) will be delegating a lot of the technical responsibility for those modules to that group. It may also remind some folks of the Super Reviewers. It’s similar to that in spirit (a group of people charged with a global view of the product) but not in mechanics (no sr? flags, and limited to the Firefox frontend modules).
> 
> This isn't a permanent appointment. We've asked these people to help get us started working through the gofaster and deXULinisation initiatives, but we'll cycle people in an out as events warrant. Nor do we expect these people to do it alone. We expect them to be working closely with all the engineers on the team.
> 
> Thanks to the Firefox Architects for stepping up.

 

现在差不多已经成型了:

不过目前在 Mozilla 之外还没有看到什么内容.
