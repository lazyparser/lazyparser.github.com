[Issue 4280: Ignition interpreter tracking bug](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=4280)

[Ignition: V8 Interpreter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11T2CRex9hXxoJwbYqVQ32yIPMh0uouUZLdyrtmMoL44/preview?pli=1&sle=true#)

> # **Background**
> 
> The machine code generated by V8’s full-codegen compiler is verbose, and as such, can contribute significantly to the amount of memory used by V8’s heap for typical web-pages (a [previous analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zYq6GDjSIue9JNEC9y3py8cRIcgY_vJi-j40brA7Q00/edit) showed that the code-space contributed to around 15-20% of the JS heap). The aim of the ignition project is to build an interpreter for V8 which executes a low-level bytecode, thus enabling run-once or non-hot code to be stored more compactly in bytecode form. An added advantage of the bytecode is that it could be fed into a Turbofan graph generator directly, thereby avoiding the need to reparse the JavaScript source code when optimizing a function

V8 也要开始加解释器了, 架构上跟 SpiderMonkey 基本上没啥差别了. 嘿嘿.

Spartan/Microsoft Edge 的 Chakra 也加入了 Simple JIT, 于是现在四大JS引擎的架构都统一了:

解释器 -> Baseline JIT / Simple JIT -> Opt JIT / Full JIT (Optional Off Threading)
