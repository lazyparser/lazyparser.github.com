CALL FOR PAPERS

OCCP 2013

1st Workshop on Optimistic Cooperation in Concurrent Programming

Rome, Italy, March 16th, 2013 (collocated with ETAPS 2013)

[http://www.scss.tcd.ie/Vasileios.Koutavas/occp-workshop/](http://www.scss.tcd.ie/Vasileios.Koutavas/occp-workshop/) ------------------------------\------------------------------\----

\* DESCRIPTION

Optimistic concurrency has long been accepted as a convenient method for programming systems where there is contention for resources. Traditionally in database systems and more recently in software transactional memory systems, optimistic concurrency is realized in the form of transactions, which the programmer can assume run isolated from their environment, thereby alleviating the need for explicit programming of locking schemes.

Recent research on concurrent programming models have lead to the realization in both academia and industry that optimistic concurrency can also be advantageous in programming systems where concurrent processes need to cooperate to perform a desired task. In such systems transactional isolation needs to be abandoned.  This brings forward numerous challenges in 1) the design and implementation of such systems, 2) the invention of appropriate programming language support for optimistic process cooperation, 3) the semantics, theory and verification of these systems.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry who work on aspects of optimistic process cooperation. It also aims to connect the different research communities pertinent to this field. These include the programming language community, the systems community and the concurrent calculi community.

\* SCOPE

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

\- Programming language support for optimistic process cooperation. - Semantics and theory of optimistic process cooperation. - Compilation techniques and runtime systems. - Calculi for modelling optimistic process cooperation in concurrent and distributed computing. - Use of optimistic cooperation in the modelling of service-oriented and biological systems. - Reversible computation. - Static analysis and verification of systems employing optimistic process cooperation. - Programming idioms for optimistic process cooperation. - Applications where optimistic process cooperation can provide a significant benefit to the programmer. - Experience reports of existing systems and prototypes employing forms of optimistic cooperation.

\* INVITED SPEAKERS

\- Suresh Jagannathan (Purdue University) - Victor Luchangco (Oracle Labs)

\* TUTORIALS

\- Matthew Fluet  (Rochester Institute of Technology)  Transactional Events - Vasileios Koutavas  (Trinity College Dublin)  Theory of Optimistic Cooperation

\* PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

Submitted papers should contain previously unpublished complete work, work in progress, or experience reports. Submissions should be in PDF format, prepared using the EPTCS style ([http://style.eptcs.org/](http://style.eptcs.org/)), and should be from 7 to 15 pages long, including references. Papers must be submitted through the Easychair page of the workshop: [http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=occp2013](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=occp2013)

Accepted papers will be distributed in electronic preliminary proceedings at the workshop. Subsequently, selected papers will be invited for publication in a post-workshop refereed proceedings in Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science.
